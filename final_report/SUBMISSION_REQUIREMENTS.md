# Final Project Submission Requirements

## Dataset Upload Requirements

**IMPORTANT: For all projects, any dataset you use or generate must be uploaded to a shared drive.**

This includes:
- GPS datasets
- Synthetic datasets you generated
- Any additional datasets collected from the internet
- Labeled PGN chess games

**You may use the university provided drive (up to 2 TB). If you have Gemini Pro, you may also use your university Google Drive.**

### GPS Dataset Format

The dataset must follow this structure:

```
dataset_root/
├── images/
└── gt.csv
```

The `gt.csv` file must contain (3 columns):
1. `image_name.png` / `image_name.jpg`
2. Latitude
3. Longitude

Each row must correspond to one image in the `images/` folder.

### Chess Dataset Format

**PGN based data:**
Save the PGN files exactly in the same format as the provided ground truth games.

**Synthetic or real image based data:**
Organize the data as follows (per game or per dataset):

```
dataset_root/
├── images/
└── gt.csv
```

The `gt.csv` file must contain 3 columns:
1. `image_name.png` / `image_name.jpg`
2. FEN string corresponding to the image
3. View specification (e.g., _white pieces closer to the camera_ or _black pieces closer to the camera_)

Each row must correctly match the image and its board state.

## Final Report Guidelines (All Projects)

Each project submission must include a **final written report** describing the problem, methodology, experiments, and conclusions.

The report should be written in the **style of a scientific paper**, following the structure outlined below.

### Length & Format

- **Maximum length:** up to 25 pages
- **Font size:** 12 pt (or standard LaTeX article/conference defaults)
- **Format:** PDF
- **Language:** English

**Important:**
- You are not required to use all 25 pages.
- Do not artificially inflate the report length.
- Extra pages are intended for figures, tables, experiments, and ablations.

### Recommended Report Structure

#### 1. Abstract
Concise summary of:
- The problem
- Your approach
- Main results

#### 2. Introduction
- Task description and motivation
- Challenges and goals
- Main contributions

#### 3. Related Work

# Evaluation API Specification

## Projects 1 & 2 – Chessboard State Prediction

### Overview

In **Projects 1 and 2**, each submission **must implement a final evaluation function** that receives a **single RGB image of a chessboard** and returns a **structured 2D representation of the board state**.

This function will be used for **automatic evaluation**, therefore its **signature, output format, device placement, and value conventions must be followed exactly**.

### Required Function

Students must implement the following function:

```python
def predict_board(image: np.ndarray) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Predict the chessboard state from a single RGB image.
    """
```

### Input Specification

**image**
- Type: `numpy.ndarray`
- Shape: `(H, W, 3)`
- Channel order: **RGB**
- Dtype: `uint8`
- Value range: `[0, 255]`
- The image contains a **single chessboard**, possibly under varying illumination, viewpoint (black or white view), or partial occlusion.

### Output Specification

The function must return a **2D tensor** representing the chessboard state.

**Tensor Requirements**
- Type: `torch.Tensor`
- Shape: **(8, 8)**
- Device: **CPU**
- Dtype: `torch.int64` (or compatible integer type)

Each element in the tensor corresponds to **one square on the chessboard**.

### Board Coordinate Convention

- `output[0, 0]` corresponds to the **top-left chess board square of the image**
- `output[0, 7]` → top-right square
- `output[7, 0]` → bottom-left square
- `output[7, 7]` → bottom-right square

**Important:**
The mapping is purely **image-based**, not chess notation based (i.e., no assumption of White/Black orientation).

### Class Encoding

Each square in the output tensor must contain an integer value in the range [0, 14], according to the following encoding:

| Value | Class |
|-------|-------|
| 0 | White Pawn |
| 1 | White Rook |
| 2 | White Knight |
| 3 | White Bishop |
| 4 | White Queen |
| 5 | White King |
| 6 | Black Pawn |
| 7 | Black Rook |
| 8 | Black Knight |
| 9 | Black Bishop |
| 10 | Black Queen |
| 11 | Black King |
| 12 | Empty Square |
| 13 | Out-of-Distribution (OOD) / Unknown / Invalid (project 1 only) |

### Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Handling (Project 1 only)

If a square:
- Does not contain a valid chess piece
- Is occluded or ambiguous
- Contains an object not belonging to the 12 known classes or it's not a clear empty square (occluded etc)

→ **Return 13 for that square**.

Using 13 is **mandatory** for all uncertain predictions.

**Output image (save in ./results/)** Project 1: for OOD squares draw red **X**

### Example Output

```python
tensor([
    [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 9, 8, 7],
    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12],
    [12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12],
    [12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12],
    [12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1]
])
```

### Additional Constraints

- ❌ Do **not** return probabilities or logits
- ❌ Do **not** return NumPy arrays
- ❌ Do **not** return tensors on GPU
- ✅ The function must run **independently** without interactive input
- ✅ The output must be **deterministic** given the same image

### Evaluation Notes

The evaluation system will:
- Call `predict_board(...)`
- Verify tensor **shape, dtype, device**
- Compare predicted values against ground truth

Any deviation from the specification may result in **automatic failure**.

## Project 3 – Chessboard Image Generation from FEN

### Overview

In **Project 3**, each submission must implement a final evaluation function that receives a **ground-truth chess position (FEN)** and a **viewpoint specification**, and generates:

1. A **synthetic chessboard image**
2. A **realistic chessboard image**
3. A **side-by-side comparison image**

The outputs must be saved to disk in a **fixed directory structure**.

These results will be used for **manual evaluation**, therefore **file paths, formats, and naming conventions must be followed exactly**.

### Required Function

Students must implement the following function:

```python
def generate_chessboard_image(fen: str, viewpoint: str) -> None:
    """
    Generate synthetic and realistic chessboard images from a given FEN.
    """
```

### Input Specification

**fen**
- Type: `str`
- Format: **FEN string**
- Must follow **exactly the same format and conventions** as the ground-truth FENs provided in the CSV files for Projects 1 & 2.

**viewpoint**
- Type: `str`
- Allowed values:
  - `"white"` – white-side view
  - `"black"` – black-side view

The viewpoint defines the **camera orientation** / **board orientation** in the generated images, it just means if black pieces or white pieces are closer to the camera.

### Output Specification

The function **must save images to disk** under the following directory:

```
./results/
```

All images must be saved **independently**, not returned from the function.

### Required Output Files

For each `(fen, viewpoint)` pair, the following files must be generated:

#### 1. Synthetic Image

**Path:** `./results/synthetic.png`

Description:
- A clean, synthetic rendering of the chessboard as you used in your data.
- No photorealism required here (it's the synthetic image)
- Must accurately reflect the input FEN and viewpoint

#### 2. Realistic Image

**Path:** `./results/realistic.png`

Description:
- A realistic image derived from the synthetic image
- Must preserve as best as you can the **board state and viewpoint in the fen and synthetic image you used.**

#### 3. Side-by-Side Comparison Image

**Path:** `./results/side_by_side.png`

Description:
- A single image showing:
  - **Left:** synthetic image
  - **Right:** realistic image
- Images must be aligned and clearly visible

### Image Format Requirements

- File format: PNG
- Color format: RGB

Resolution is **not fixed**, but all three images must have **compatible dimensions** such that side-by-side visualization is clear.

### Viewpoint Consistency

The generated images must reflect the given viewpoint:
- `"white"` → white pieces closest to the camera
- `"black"` → black pieces closest to the camera

No assumptions about chess notation orientation are allowed beyond the viewpoint input.

### Additional Constraints

- ❌ Do not return images from the function
- ❌ Do not require interactive input
- ❌ Do not overwrite files outside `./results/`
- ✅ The function must be deterministic for the same `(fen, viewpoint)`
- ✅ The function must create the `./results/` directory if it does not exist

## Project 4 – Image-to-GPS Regression

### Overview

In **Project 4**, each submission must implement a final evaluation function that receives a **single RGB image** and returns a **GPS coordinate prediction**: **latitude** and **longitude**.

This function will be used for **automatic evaluation**, therefore its **signature, input format, output format, and conventions must be followed exactly**.

### Required Function

Students must implement the following function:

```python
def predict_gps(image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Predict GPS latitude and longitude from a single RGB image.
    """
```

### Input Specification

**image**
- Type: `numpy.ndarray`
- Shape: `(H, W, 3)`
- Channel order: **RGB** (NOT BGR)
- Dtype: `uint8`
- Value range: `[0, 255]`

The image corresponds to a real location from the dataset. Images may include viewpoint changes, illumination differences, occlusions, and motion blur.

### Output Specification

The function must return a **NumPy array** containing the predicted GPS coordinate.

**Array Requirements**
- Type: `numpy.ndarray`
- Shape: **(2,)**
- Dtype: floating type (`float32`)
- Format:
  - `output[0]` = **latitude**
  - `output[1]` = **longitude**

### Important Notes

- The returned values must be the absolute GPS coordinates (e.g, not relative meters).
- Predictions must be as accurate as possible because evaluation is done against the exact ground-truth GPS for each images. (which means "5 meter" error is considered perfect (and probably not achievable) results, as GPS give accurate location result up to 5 meters. I will take some margin (some more mistake than 5 meters will still be considered as perfect result, but I will not provide you with that number!). I will do that since different phones have different focal lengths and field of views.

### Example Output

```python
np.array([31.262345, 34.803210], dtype=np.float32)
```

### Additional Constraints

- ❌ Do not return a list/tuple (must be `np.ndarray`)
- ❌ Do not return strings
- ❌ Do not return meters or any relative coordinate system
- ✅ No interactive input
- ✅ Must run end-to-end from a single function call

### Evaluation Notes

The evaluation system will:
- Call `predict_gps(image)`
- Verify output:
  - Type is `np.ndarray`
  - Shape is `(2,)`
  - Values are finite floats
  - Latitude/longitude are within valid ranges
- Compare against the ground truth GPS for each test image (exact latitude/longitude format from the dataset).

Any deviation from the specification may result in **automatic failure**.

## Project 5 – WTConv

You should provide a comparison code between WTConv and your WTConv implementation that compares the times.

It should also compare basic network training using your WTConv against the Real WTConv comparing the total time (of all the training) and accuracy (using the same seed, weights etc). 

You can choose any standard architecture that we learned like ResNet, MobileNet, ConvNext etc (need to choose 1).
